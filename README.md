# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Project Description


In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a version 2.0 of an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app regarding citi bikes in New York. See [Green Life NYC](https://wct2112.shinyapps.io/greenlivingnewyork/) (focused on mapping) and [Citi Bike](https://krozzzz.shinyapps.io/Final_vision/) (focused on routing, although the the functionality did not work as it was tried in September 2018) for the previous works on the same subject.

+ **Project summary**: Our web app aims at optimizing decision making with regards to the usage of Citi Bike in New York. First, a routing utility is available, that allows users to enter their current location and a destination and be guided as to where to walk to the closest Citi Bike non-empty station and where to drop off at the non-full station closest to destination. Additionally, bike station availability, bike routes, the rain radar, the 3-D histogram representing the frequency of bike usage and the heat map corrspoinding with crime rate on the streets are available to allow users to further refine the routing.

  The data is available at the following links:
  + [live Citybike station data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
  + [NYC bike routes](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml)
