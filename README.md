![screenshot](doc/screenshot2.png)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a version 2.0 of an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app regarding city bikes in New York. See [Green Life NYC](https://wct2112.shinyapps.io/greenlivingnewyork/) (focussed on mapping) and [City Bike] (https://krozzzz.shinyapps.io/Final_vision/) (focussed on routing, although the the functionality did not work as it was tried in September 2018) for the previous works on the same subject.

+ **Project summary**: The web app aims at optimizing decision making with regards to the usage of City Bike in New York. First a routing utility is available, that allows users to enter an address and a destination and be guided as to where to walk to the closest City Bike non-empty station and where to drop off at the non-full station closest to destination. Additionally, live bike station data, bike routes, a rain radar and a heat map of the amount of felonies on the streets are available to allow the user to further refine her routing.

  The data is available at the followingg links:
  + [live Citybike station data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
  + [NYC bike routes](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml)
